Rather, Apple’s latest pro laptop experienced a subdued\n                launch, in spite of it offering a notable spec upgrade over the 2017 model – along with an improved\n                keyboard.

This is because, while the iPhone\n                XS and iPad, along with the 12-inch MacBook, are aimed at everyday consumers, the MacBook Pro has always\n                aimed at the creative and professional audience.

So, if you’re just looking for the most\n                powerful MacBook on the market, you’ll love this new MacBook Pro. Just keep in mind that, while the\n                keyboard has been updated, there are still some issues with it.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                There’s enough of a difference between the two sizes when it comes to performance to warrant two\n                separate reviews, and here we’ll be looking at how the flagship 15-inch MacBook Pro performs in 2019.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                It's build quality and design is batter than elit.
